Prompt: Add N staff activity log entries that intentionally violate the policy

Description:
Please add N new rows to the staff activity log CSV file located at system_log/staff_activity_log.csv. Each row must be crafted using facts available in knowledge_base/knowledge_base.csv and must trigger exactly one rule from policy/policy.pl. After adding entries, verify that each new row triggers only the intended rule.

Constraints and requirements:
- N: replace <N> with the number of entries (e.g., 10).
- For each added entry, include these fields in CSV format:
  log_id,principal,action,resource,lab_result,clinical_note,billing_info,purpose,timestamp,label
- Timestamp format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (e.g., 2025-08-30T12:00:00).
- Use principals, PHI records, and roles consistent with knowledge_base/knowledge_base.csv.
- Each added entry must violate exactly one rule from policy/policy.pl (no multi-rule entries). If an initial choice triggers more than one rule, adjust principal/purpose/attributes until only one rule fires.
- Prefer a balanced mix across rules; e.g., split the N entries across hipaa_auth, hipaa_min_necessary, gdpr_art18_restriction.
- Label the row using the format used in the repo: label should be the specific violation label, e.g., violation_hipaa_auth, violation_hipaa_min_necessary, violation_gdpr_art18.

Example brief request (fill placeholders):
"Add 10 staff log entries. Create 4 entries violating hipaa_auth, 3 violating hipaa_min_necessary, and 3 violating gdpr_art18_restriction. Use timestamps in August 2025. Save into system_log/staff_activity_log.csv and return a table mapping log_id -> triggered_rule."
